Please see below response.

(1) Do we have to reconcile Corporate Card and/or Air/Rail Central Pay transactions before travel dates going forward? Usually we reconcile these after completing trips.
Your are correct, future dated trip should be reconcile after the trip.

(2) Michael had people from other departments on the list (Hysa, Serxhio-Engineering;  Roberts, Leah from CUMC Epidemiology). Why do we receive reports for people outside of Columbia Health? We haven't authorized travel for them.
Hysa's charge should not have gone to Michael. As for Leah Roberts, Her Concur profile does have school (160000X).

(3) Are email confirmations generated by Concur after booking trips considered sufficient backup for Corporate Card and/or Air/Rail Central Pay transactions reconciliations? Is any additional documentation required?
No, the copy of the ticket should be updated.

(4) Why I didn't get the email that Michael got? It's my understanding that we have the same level of access.

Domestic travel includes travel within the United States and its territories. All other destinations are considered international travel. When booking your lodging be cognizant of the thresholds applicable to either domestic or international travel.

Lodging costs in excess of $350 per night in the US and $400 per night in an International location (by no more than 50%) requires payee justification and Financial Approval. Additionally, lodging costs in excess of $525 per night in the US and $600 per night in an International location (more than 50%) requires Senior Business Officer approval.

If a conference is held in a hotel where the rate exceeds these amounts, please attach the conference flyer identifying the location of the conference and the offered hotel accommodations.

The designated department staff member should submit an expense report under their profile in concur, but the report type would be Non-Profiled Payee instead of travel or business. After you select Non-profiled payee as the report type, further down on the page two fields for vendor type and vendor ID will appear. If you find that nothing populates when entering the vendor ID in the vendor name section, you should change filter for that field to ""either"" by clicking on the down arrow next to the funnel icon. Then enter CNR or vendor ID, it should then populate if the vendor ID is active. If it does not please go back to vendor type and make sure that the correct type was selected. Continue to fill out the rest of the report and submit.

Why are Dr. Carmel's expense reports going to Barbara Rosenberg for approval? Can we resolve the issue of incorrect approval routing for department 7532410?,in-scope,,"As we discussed, please pass this message to your Business Manager:

The reason Dr. Carmel's expense reports are going to Barbara Rosenberg as the Financial Approver is that the people who were set up as the Concur Level 1, 2, and 3 financial approvers for department 7532410 (Angela Ali and Stephanie Blaney) are no longer active approvers for the department. Barbara is the Level 4 Concur financial approver for department 7532410, and if there are no active approvers below level 4 the report will route to the level 4 approver.

To resolve this issue active approver(s) for department 7532410 need to be set up as the Concur ""Default Financial Approver"" for department 7532410. To have this done your department should reach out to Raquel Marin (rm2698) in the CUMC Controller's Office. The department should provide the approvers who should be set up as the level 1, 2, and 3 default financial approvers for department 7532410 and Raquel can make this change. ",valid,

Can I use the Corporate Card or the Guest's Credit Card to book a hotel for my guest?,in-scope,,"https://travel-expense.finance.columbia.edu/content/travel-how-tos

A corporate or personal credit card is required to guarantee all hotel bookings and the card is only charged in the event of a no-show, or if the booking is not canceled by the specified cancelation deadline. If the cardholder is also the traveler, the same card may be presented at check-in to pay for the hotel stay. 

Note: The card used to guarantee the booking does not automatically prepay or direct bill a hotel stay. If you are booking a hotel for a guest and you would like their hotel stay to be billed to a CU corporate card (instead of the guest's card), you can set up Direct Billing with the specific hotel.  Please follow these security guidelines:

Section 6 Set up Direct Billing at Hotel
Contact the hotel directly
Request a third party credit card authorization form
Never email or fax a complete credit card number to any hotel
Never email or fax a photo of the credit card or the cardholder's driver's license
Complete credit card numbers should always be provided to the hotel over the phone
Credit card authorizations should only include the last four digits of the card number that has been provided over the phone
These guidelines are critical to the security of credit cards while ensuring that an alternate credit card is directly billed for the guest's stay.

Section 7  Universtity Travel and Expense Corporate Card
The Travel and Expense Corporate Card (T&E Corporate Card) is a Visa credit card issued by Bank of America. It can be used by eligible individuals to pay for University-approved travel and business-related expenses. It is a corporate liable card product with all expenses paid by the University, reducing the need for out-of-pocket expenditures by employees. However, please note that the cardholder is responsible for the monthly reconciliation of charges in Concur.

For information about the Travel and Expense Corporate Card, including training and applications, visit Travel and Expense Corporate Card (https://travel-expense.finance.columbia.edu/content/travel-and-expense-corporate-card).

1. Initial reviewer (IR): This is driven by two different things
A: If the Concur user has a supervisor in their Concur Profile, it will automatically route to the listed supervisor in Concur. for the initial review. To find out if there is a
supervisor in the profile you can provide me with the UNI and I can check. To remove the supervisor, you must submit a request via ServiceNow.
B. if they don't have a listed supervisor in Concur then it will be driven by the admin information entered at the very top of the report header (school, division, sub-division,
admin department). The initial reviewer will be determined by who has security access to the that department as an IR. You can add people to be IR's for specific
departments via an FSSA.

2. Financial Approvers (FA): is driven by department field of the chartstring provided in the Report Header. Whoever has permissions to approve for that specific department provided in the chartstring will determine who it routes to for approval.
