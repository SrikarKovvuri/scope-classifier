I use a corporate card to book air and lodging. Do I need any specific guidance for using the card?,in-scope,,"Travel and Expense Corporate Card Policy
The Travel and Expense (T&E) Corporate Card is a credit card used by authorized University employees to enable certain types of payments while performing University business. It is a method to pay for travel and business related expenses and must adhere to the University's Travel and Business expense policies. All T&E Corporate Card charges are centrally paid by the University.

Concur Travel and Expense is the authorized system for all T&E Corporate Card activity substantiation, report submission, receipt retention, and approval.

This policy defines the circumstances under which an employee of the University may apply for and use the T&E Corporate Card. The card may not be used for personal purchases and expenses. An employee may only use the card while employed by the University; once the employee is separated from the University, the card will be cancelled.

The T&E Corporate Card may be used by employees for their travel and business expenses. Air or rail - must be booked via the University's Business Travel Account (BTA) also referred to as Air/Rail Central Pay Account on file with our Travel Management Company or booked with a personal credit card.

The T&E Corporate Card may not be used to charge air and rail expenses for any other employee or guest. Air and rail expenses for other employees or guests can only be booked by a designated departmental Travel Arranger, and must be booked through the University's Travel Management Company (TMC) or booked with a personal credit card.  

Since our Business Travel Account (BTA)/ Air/Rail Central Pay Account already covers air and rail, the Corporate card should only be used to charge air/rail expenses outside of our Travel Management Company in emergency situations. In such cases, the cardholder must provide a justification for using the T&E Corporate card for air or rail expenses.

Employees are not required to utilize the T&E Corporate Card. They have the option of using a personal credit card for University authorized travel and business related expenses and request reimbursement of those expenses.

Accounts Payable will review T&E Corporate Card statements and transactions for compliance with University policies and may terminate the card at any time for cause (i.e. violation of policy or failure to reconcile card transactions timely).

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

-If you only need the initial reviewer role and DO Not plan to submit your own expense reimbursements:
1. Apply for Columbia's affiliate access through the FSSA found here:

***Note that in addition to marking off the Concur temporary access in section 2.2, you must also complete section 2.1 and specify the role you need.

-If you need both the initial reviewer role and the ability to submit your own expense reimbursements:
1. Before completing the FSSA, ensure you have an active outside party ID.I checked and it you currently don't have one, so you'll need to be invited to PaymentWorks to register for an outside party ID.
2. Once the vendor ID is established, you can then submit the FSSA following the steps mentioned above.

Your Supervisor, JIHEUM PARK has not completed the Concur Supervisor Training , therefore your expense is not going to route to his approval. Expense approval workflow is designed in a way that the expense routes to a supervisor if only the supervisor has completed the concur supervisor training otherwise it routes to initial reviewer & You must select an initial reviewer assigned to your department . Based on your concur profile I have attached a list of approvers.
If your expense has to be approved by your supervisor then your department DA has to opt in your supervisor to have the concur approval role and a training will be assigned and once the training is completed the expense will route to the supervisors approval once submitted.
I have also attached a job aid on how to opt in a supervisor if needed

The costs related to an earlier departure and/or later return for airfare or rail fare may be reimbursed when the total cost of the airfare or rail fare is clearly documented and demonstrated to be equal to or lower than it would have been for the dates required for business travel. Payee justification is required on the Expense Report that documents the personal days in the itinerary.

The University will not assume the cost or reimburse the cost of lodging, local transportation, meals or other costs in excess of the minimum days necessary for travel or conference attendance. If the traveler does not have a legitimate business purpose for expenses (not including air or rail fare) incurred for their extended stay, all costs charged to either the University's Business Travel Account (BTA)/Air/Rail Central Pay Account or Travel & Expense Corporate Card will need to be reimbursed to the University. Out of pocket expenses will also not be reimbursed to the traveler.


Documentation Required

If air or rail expenses related to an earlier departure and/or later return are being reimbursed, the total cost of airfare or rail fare should be compared to the costs for traveling on the dates required for business travel. Documentation should include a price quote from either the air carrier and/ or rail carrier for the dates that would have been used if the travel was not extended. All documentation requirements for the specific expenditure type apply.

The traveler is expected to obtain receipts for all expenses for which they plan to have reimbursed. A receipt may take many forms (i.e. cash register receipt, copy

of an order form, web receipt or confirmation). A receipt must identify:

the date of purchase
the vendor name
itemized list and unit price of the purchased items
the total amount
 

If the traveler is unable to obtain a receipt that contains all the required information, documentation should be submitted to demonstrate as many of the required items as possible. A copy of the traveler's credit or debit card statement identifying the date, location and amount of the expense, or a rental agreement, may be submitted along with a description of the purchase, identifying the amount of any expenses to be segregated (e.g. alcohol).
                                                             

Receipts must be provided for all air, rail, lodging, and rental car expenses. For all other expense types, receipts must be provided if the expense is equal to or in excess of $50. Otherwise, Payee Justification and Financial Approval is required and a Missing Receipt Affidavit must be completed.

                                                  

Proof of Payment

The Federal Government will not reimburse certain expenses, termed ""unallowables"" and has set forth guidelines prohibiting these costs from being charged to Federal grants and contracts, either directly or indirectly. These include expenditures for alcohol, entertainment, flowers or gifts or excessive costs, such as first or business class travel and lodging or meals over the designated University thresholds. To make sure that the University does not inadvertently charge any of these expenses to grants and contracts, ""unallowable"" expenses have been assigned to the appropriate account.
