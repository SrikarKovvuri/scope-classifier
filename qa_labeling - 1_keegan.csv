The approval workflow in concur is designed in a way that the report goes directly to supervisor approval if there is a supervisor listed in PAC under your profile.

EVAGELIA TERZOPOULOS CUNNINGHAM and your expense directly routes to her upon your submission, however, the supervisor also needs to be opted in through concur for approval and must have completed the supervisor training in order to accomplish this task
I have attached a job aid on how to opt in Supervisors and once Evagelia is opted in a training will be assigned to her.

Reasonable and necessary meal expenses for business meetings involving only University personnel and students during which focused business discussions take place. The frequency of such meetings and the related expenses must be reasonable and appropriate to the purpose of the discussion and the nature of the business conducted. Such meetings include:
Breakfast, lunch and dinner meetings which are necessary to conduct University business.
Formally organized meetings which are necessary to carry out the business of official committees appointed by the University, School or Department.
Meetings of an organized work group of employees or students that require the work of the group to progress through normal meal time.
Reasonable and necessary meal expenses for peer groups for research collaboration or administrative meetings during which focused business discussions take place.
                                                  

Except under rare circumstances, these meals to be reimbursed or meals to be paid via invoice directly to the vendor should not exceed the following thresholds, excluding tips and tax:

Up to $25 for breakfast
Up to $35 for lunch
Up to $75 for dinner
Please Note: Tips/Gratuities in excess of 20 percent will not be reimbursed.

What are my options for justifying airfare already purchased?",in scope,," two scenarios where you are expected to provide a comparison flight

1. First or Business Class Travel

Travel must be booked utilizing the Lowest Logical Fare (LLF) as defined above. Business class may be used for travel if your department's or school's financial approver confirms that appropriate funds are available (prior to purchase), and if any of the following conditions are met:

Any flight segment that has a scheduled in-air flight time* in excess of five hours. (Connecting flights involving at least one flight segment with a scheduled in-air flight time in excess of five hours may also be booked in business class).
A documented medical condition which requires a reasonable accommodation that has been approved by the University's Leave Management office.
If a flight meets the criteria for business class but business class is not offered (e.g. 2-class plane) the forward cabin will be considered business class, even though the ticket may be issued in first class. The traveler is responsible for documenting this exception on the Expense Report.


*Air time means the amount of time a traveler is continuously in the air on a single flight/leg.



If a traveler elects to fly in business or first class on a flight of less than five (5) hours duration, has not met the above mentioned conditions, and has not obtained the necessary financial approval, they will be reimbursed only for an amount equivalent to an economy/coach airfare.



Segregation of airfare above the economy/coach rate is required in all cases. First or business class airfare can only be charged to a government grant in cases where the grant explicitly allows such expenses. It is important to note that the cost of the lowest logical available economy/coach airfare when purchasing a business/first-class fare should be obtained by the traveler at time of initial purchase.



The amount above the economy/coach fare must be segregated to the appropriate expense type, a comparison of the coach/economy and business/first-class airfare costs must be provided, along with payee justification is required.


2. Extending Travel beyond the Minimum Days Required for Personal Reasons

The costs related to an earlier departure and/or later return for airfare or rail fare may be reimbursed when the total cost of the airfare or rail fare is clearly documented and demonstrated to be equal to or lower than it would have been for the dates required for business travel. Payee justification is required on the Expense Report that documents the personal days in the itinerary.

The University will not assume the cost or reimburse the cost of lodging, local transportation, meals or other costs in excess of the minimum days necessary for travel or conference attendance. If the traveler does not have a legitimate business purpose for expenses (not including air or rail fare) incurred for their extended stay, all costs charged to either the University's Business Travel Account (BTA)/Air/Rail Central Pay Account or Travel & Expense Corporate Card will need to be reimbursed to the University. Out of pocket expenses will also not be reimbursed to the traveler.


Documentation Required

If air or rail expenses related to an earlier departure and/or later return are being reimbursed, the total cost of airfare or rail fare should be compared to the costs for traveling on the dates required for business travel. Documentation should include a price quote from either the air carrier and/ or rail carrier for the dates that would have been used if the travel was not extended. All documentation requirements for the specific expenditure type apply.

Domestic Car Rentals

When renting a car from Hertz, the University's preferred car rental supplier in the Continental US, including Alaska, Hawaii and the District of Columbia, do not purchase Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) and/or Liability insurance as the University has negotiated the inclusion of Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) and Liability insurance for University-related business rentals. Travelers will not be reimbursed for this expense if renting from Hertz, the University's preferred car rental supplier.

If the University preferred car rental supplier is not available, other car rental companies may be used. However, Loss Damage Waiver and Liability insurance must be purchased when renting from other car rental suppliers. Note – University travelers who have been issued a Visa Corporate Card by Bank of America are covered with Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver, when the entire rental is paid for with the Corporate Card. The Visa Corporate Card does not include Liability insurance which must be purchased by the renter. Important information on Visa's Auto Rental Collision Damage coverage, as well as inclusions and exclusions may be found on the Visa Cardholder Benefit Guide.",,

When traveling for business purposes, a personal vehicle may be used in order to save time, transport equipment, reduce costs when several people are traveling together, or travel to locations within reasonable driving distance. If a personal vehicle is used primarily for the convenience of the traveler and the approved travel is to a location more than 500 miles beyond the point of origin, reimbursement will not exceed the lesser of the following: 1) the cost of per- mile reimbursement plus tolls; or, 2) the round-trip airfare between the nearest commercial airport serving the origin and destination cities, plus transfer costs to and from the airport.
                                                                       
For the business-related use of a personal vehicle, the traveler will be reimbursed at a rate based on the Federal IRS approved highway mileage guides. Mileage reimbursement covers fuel, maintenance/repairs, insurance, transportation and operating costs, so these will not be reimbursed separately. The traveler will not be reimbursed for the cost of vehicle purchase or lease.
                                                                       
In addition to the mileage allowance, tolls and necessary parking charges may be reimbursed.

 The University does not assume liability for damage to personal automobiles used on University business and does not assume liability for deductibles or any other uninsured loss to the vehicle. Expenses for vehicle repairs are not reimbursable. Under no circumstances will the University reimburse parking fines and moving violations on personal vehicle

What is the travel expense policy?,in scope,,"First or Business Class Travel

Travel must be booked utilizing the Lowest Logical Fare (LLF) as defined above. Business class may be used for travel if your department's or school's financial approver confirms that appropriate funds are available (prior to purchase), and if any of the following conditions are met:

Any flight segment that has a scheduled in-air flight time* in excess of five hours.  (Connecting flights involving at least one flight segment with a scheduled in-air flight time in excess of five hours may also be booked in business class).
A documented medical condition which requires a reasonable accommodation that has been approved by the University's Leave Management office.   
If a flight meets the criteria for business class but business class is not offered (e.g. 2-class plane) the forward cabin will be considered business class, even though the ticket may be issued in first class.  The traveler is responsible for documenting this exception on the Expense Report.
 

*Air time means the amount of time a traveler is continuously in the air on a single flight/leg.

 

If a traveler elects to fly in business or first class on a flight of less than five (5) hours duration, has not met the above mentioned conditions, and has not obtained the necessary financial approval, they will be reimbursed only for an amount equivalent to an economy/coach airfare.

 

Segregation of airfare above the economy/coach rate is required in all cases.  First or business class airfare can only be charged to a government grant in cases where the grant explicitly allows such expenses.  It is important to note that the cost of the lowest logical available economy/coach airfare when purchasing a business/first-class fare should be obtained by the traveler at time of initial purchase.

 The amount above the economy/coach fare must be segregated to the appropriate expense type, a comparison of the coach/economy and business/first-class airfare costs must be provided, along with payee justification is required

The traveler is expected to obtain receipts for all expenses for which they plan to have reimbursed. A receipt may take many forms (i.e. cash register receipt, copy

of an order form, web receipt or confirmation). A receipt must identify:

the date of purchase
the vendor name
itemized list and unit price of the purchased items
the total amount
 

If the traveler is unable to obtain a receipt that contains all the required information, documentation should be submitted to demonstrate as many of the required items as possible. A copy of the traveler's credit or debit card statement identifying the date, location and amount of the expense, or a rental agreement, may be submitted along with a description of the purchase, identifying the amount of any expenses to be segregated (e.g. alcohol).
                                                             

Receipts must be provided for all air, rail, lodging, and rental car expenses. For all other expense types, receipts must be provided if the expense is equal to or in excess of $50. Otherwise, Payee Justification and Financial Approval is required and a Missing Receipt Affidavit must be completed.

                                                  

Proof of Payment                                     

The traveler is expected to obtain proof of payment for any expenses that require receipts (as outlined by our policy). Proof of payment may take many forms but must demonstrate that payment was tendered and must identify the means by which payment was tendered by the traveler. This is often part of the receipt. Examples of this may include notation of:

""Cash Tendered""
""Paid""
A zero balance due
Debit/Credit card payment (card type, last four digits of card and/or signature)
 

If no proof of payment is available in this form, a debit or credit card statement may also be provided. Please black out any private or unrelated information.

The chartstring for your ACH payment of $6307.65 (based on below reports) should mirrored your deposit. if they match, then you can upload the deposit slip to each of the below vouchers (highlighted in yellow) as support doc. your can pull up the vouchers by searching in ARC using the report Key.

If the deposit chartsting does not match your Concur report chartstrings, then i would suggest contact your department's AP team and create a journal to offset the expense.


To answer your question on reprocessing, there's nothing to reprocess. Approved reports cannot be modify. The erroneous reports you had processed were done via receipts from charges you had already reconciled.


Thank you.
