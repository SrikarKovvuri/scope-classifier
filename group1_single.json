    "out-of-scope": "in-scope",
    "human_answer": " two scenarios where you are expected to provide a comparison flight\n\n1. First or Business Class Travel\n\nTravel must be booked utilizing the Lowest Logical Fare (LLF) as defined above. Business class may be used for travel if your department's or school's financial approver confirms that appropriate funds are available (prior to purchase), and if any of the following conditions are met:\n\nAny flight segment that has a scheduled in-air flight time* in excess of five hours. (Connecting flights involving at least one flight segment with a scheduled in-air flight time in excess of five hours may also be booked in business class).\nA documented medical condition which requires a reasonable accommodation that has been approved by the University's Leave Management office.\nIf a flight meets the criteria for business class but business class is not offered (e.g. 2-class plane) the forward cabin will be considered business class, even though the ticket may be issued in first class. The traveler is responsible for documenting this exception on the Expense Report.\n\n\n*Air time means the amount of time a traveler is continuously in the air on a single flight/leg.\n\n\n\nIf a traveler elects to fly in business or first class on a flight of less than five (5) hours duration, has not met the above mentioned conditions, and has not obtained the necessary financial approval, they will be reimbursed only for an amount equivalent to an economy/coach airfare.\n\n\n\nSegregation of airfare above the economy/coach rate is required in all cases. First or business class airfare can only be charged to a government grant in cases where the grant explicitly allows such expenses. It is important to note that the cost of the lowest logical available economy/coach airfare when purchasing a business/first-class fare should be obtained by the traveler at time of initial purchase.\n\n\n\nThe amount above the economy/coach fare must be segregated to the appropriate expense type, a comparison of the coach/economy and business/first-class airfare costs must be provided, along with payee justification is required.\n\n\n2. Extending Travel beyond the Minimum Days Required for Personal Reasons\n\nThe costs related to an earlier departure and/or later return for airfare or rail fare may be reimbursed when the total cost of the airfare or rail fare is clearly documented and demonstrated to be equal to or lower than it would have been for the dates required for business travel. Payee justification is required on the Expense Report that documents the personal days in the itinerary.\n\nThe University will not assume the cost or reimburse the cost of lodging, local transportation, meals or other costs in excess of the minimum days necessary for travel or conference attendance. If the traveler does not have a legitimate business purpose for expenses (not including air or rail fare) incurred for their extended stay, all costs charged to either the University's Business Travel Account (BTA)/Air/Rail Central Pay Account or Travel & Expense Corporate Card will need to be reimbursed to the University. Out of pocket expenses will also not be reimbursed to the traveler.\n\n\nDocumentation Required\n\nIf air or rail expenses related to an earlier departure and/or later return are being reimbursed, the total cost of airfare or rail fare should be compared to the costs for traveling on the dates required for business travel. Documentation should include a price quote from either the air carrier and/ or rail carrier for the dates that would have been used if the travel was not extended.
