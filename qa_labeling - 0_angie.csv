Obtain the cost of the lowest logical economy/coach airfare for the same flight at the time of booking the business/first-class fare.
In your Concur expense report, enter the economy/coach airfare amount under the appropriate expense type (e.g. Airfare).

I need assistance with segregating a flight expense on my Concur report. Can someone help?,in scope,,"See Travel Policy https://universitypolicies.columbia.edu/content/travel-expense-policy

First or Business Class Travel

Travel must be booked utilizing the Lowest Logical Fare (LLF) as defined above. Business class may be used for travel if your department's or school's financial approver confirms that appropriate funds are available (prior to purchase), and if any of the following conditions are met:

Any flight segment that has a scheduled in-air flight time* in excess of five hours.  (Connecting flights involving at least one flight segment with a scheduled in-air flight time in excess of five hours may also be booked in business class).
A documented medical condition which requires a reasonable accommodation that has been approved by the University's Leave Management office.   
If a flight meets the criteria for business class but business class is not offered (e.g. 2-class plane) the forward cabin will be considered business class, even though the ticket may be issued in first class.  The traveler is responsible for documenting this exception on the Expense Report.
 
*Air time means the amount of time a traveler is continuously in the air on a single flight/leg.

If a traveler elects to fly in business or first class on a flight of less than five (5) hours duration, has not met the above mentioned conditions, and has not obtained the necessary financial approval, they will be reimbursed only for an amount equivalent to an economy/coach airfare.

Segregation of airfare above the economy/coach rate is required in all cases.  First or business class airfare can only be charged to a government grant in cases where the grant explicitly allows such expenses.  It is important to note that the cost of the lowest logical available economy/coach airfare when purchasing a business/first-class fare should be obtained by the traveler at time of initial purchase.

 

The amount above the economy/coach fare must be segregated to the appropriate expense type, a comparison of the coach/economy and business/first-class airfare costs must be provided, along with payee justification is required.",valid,

I want to understand what is causing my Expense Report to require SBO approval. Is there something I can do to avoid it?,in scope,,"In this case, it's appears to be a known system limitation, and not an actual policy violation. Per the travel arrangers job aid on page 4 in the note section under number 7 found here: https://www.finance.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Training%20Documents/Concur/Job%20Aids/Job_Aid_Concur_Travel_Arrangers.pdf
Note: Individual meal thresholds apply to Non-Profiled Payee Expense Reports. However, due to system limitations the calculation includes tip and tax. The amount over threshold
must be segregated. SBO approval is required when meal expenses exceed individual meal thresholds. This info can be found here

On 10/5 a lunch expense was submitted for $36.98, the lunch threshold hold is $35 before tax and tip, but since this is a non-profiled payee the system thinks it went over the threshold which triggers SBO approval. The SBOs are aware of this issue. You will have to segregate the ""overage"" and secure the necessary approval. You may also need to check the other meals to ensure they also don't need to be segregated.

SBO approvals are needed for certain policy exceptions, there is no way to avoid them.
The following scenarios require SBO approval
• Meals over thresholds
• Lodging over $525 domestic, $600 international
• Entertainment expense is greater than $1,500 or the per person cost is greater than $75
• Business performance or de minimis gifts to employees exceeding $100
• Years of Service or Retirement Gift to employees exceeding $400
• Gifts to non-employees exceeding $600

What is the travel expense reimbursement policy?,in scope,,"Here is what the policy says about the use of private vehicle

Travel by Private Vehicle
When traveling for business purposes, a personal vehicle may be used in order to save time, transport equipment, reduce costs when several people are traveling together, or travel to locations within reasonable driving distance. If a personal vehicle is used primarily for the convenience of the traveler and the approved travel is to a location more than 500 miles beyond the point of origin, reimbursement will not exceed the lesser of the following: 1) the cost of per- mile reimbursement plus tolls; or, 2) the round-trip airfare between the nearest commercial airport serving the origin and destination cities, plus transfer costs to and from the airport.

For the business-related use of a personal vehicle, the traveler will be reimbursed at a rate based on the Federal IRS approved highway mileage guides. Mileage reimbursement covers fuel, maintenance/repairs, insurance, transportation and operating costs, so these will not be reimbursed separately. The traveler will not be reimbursed for the cost of vehicle purchase or lease.

In addition to the mileage allowance, tolls and necessary parking charges may be reimbursed.



The University does not assume liability for damage to personal automobiles used on University business and does not assume liability for deductibles or any other uninsured loss to the vehicle. Expenses for vehicle repairs are not reimbursable. Under no circumstances will the University reimburse parking fines and moving violations on personal vehicle

Supervisors can be opted in by the DAF of the department and required training will be assigned. Once the training is completed she will be able to approve your expense report

Travel by Private Vehicle                                            
When traveling for business purposes, a personal vehicle may be used in order to save time, transport equipment, reduce costs when several people are traveling together, or travel to locations within reasonable driving distance. If a personal vehicle is used primarily for the convenience of the traveler and the approved travel is to a location more than 500 miles beyond the point of origin, reimbursement will not exceed the lesser of the following: 1) the cost of per- mile reimbursement plus tolls; or, 2) the round-trip airfare between the nearest commercial airport serving the origin and destination cities, plus transfer costs to and from the airport.
                                                                       
For the business-related use of a personal vehicle, the traveler will be reimbursed at a rate based on the Federal IRS approved highway mileage guides. Mileage reimbursement covers fuel, maintenance/repairs, insurance, transportation and operating costs, so these will not be reimbursed separately. The traveler will not be reimbursed for the cost of vehicle purchase or lease.
                                                                       
In addition to the mileage allowance, tolls and necessary parking charges may be reimbursed.

                                                  

The University does not assume liability for damage to personal automobiles used on University business and does not assume liability for deductibles or any other uninsured loss to the vehicle. Expenses for vehicle repairs are not reimbursable. Under no circumstances will the University reimburse parking fines and moving violations on personal vehicle

Travel by Private Vehicle                                            
When traveling for business purposes, a personal vehicle may be used in order to save time, transport equipment, reduce costs when several people are traveling together, or travel to locations within reasonable driving distance. If a personal vehicle is used primarily for the convenience of the traveler and the approved travel is to a location more than 500 miles beyond the point of origin, reimbursement will not exceed the lesser of the following: 1) the cost of per- mile reimbursement plus tolls; or, 2) the round-trip airfare between the nearest commercial airport serving the origin and destination cities, plus transfer costs to and from the airport.
                                                                       
For the business-related use of a personal vehicle, the traveler will be reimbursed at a rate based on the Federal IRS approved highway mileage guides. Mileage reimbursement covers fuel, maintenance/repairs, insurance, transportation and operating costs, so these will not be reimbursed separately. The traveler will not be reimbursed for the cost of vehicle purchase or lease.
                                                                       
In addition to the mileage allowance, tolls and necessary parking charges may be reimbursed.

                                                  

The University does not assume liability for damage to personal automobiles used on University business and does not assume liability for deductibles or any other uninsured loss to the vehicle. Expenses for vehicle repairs are not reimbursable. Under no circumstances will the University reimburse parking fines and moving violations on personal vehicle

The costs related to an earlier departure and/or later return for airfare or rail fare may be reimbursed when the total cost of the airfare or rail fare is clearly documented and demonstrated to be equal to or lower than it would have been for the dates required for business travel. Payee justification is required on the Expense Report that documents the personal days in the itinerary.

The University will not assume the cost or reimburse the cost of lodging, local transportation, meals or other costs in excess of the minimum days necessary for travel or conference attendance. If the traveler does not have a legitimate business purpose for expenses (not including air or rail fare) incurred for their extended stay, all costs charged to either the University's Business Travel Account (BTA)/Air/Rail Central Pay Account or Travel & Expense Corporate Card will need to be reimbursed to the University.  Out of pocket expenses will also not be reimbursed to the traveler.
 

Documentation Required                              

If air or rail expenses related to an earlier departure and/or later return are being reimbursed, the total cost of airfare or rail fare should be compared to the costs for traveling on the dates required for business travel. Documentation should include a price quote from either the air carrier and/ or rail carrier for the dates that would have been used if the travel was not extended.

Charges on the BTA account can be reconcile independent of each other. Reconciling the Agent Fee on a different expense report is not an issue, Concur will automatically allocation the charge to the Columbia BTA account without additional action.
In responses to your request to move the agent fee to your credit card is not a normal process and WTI would most will not do it, as they have to credit the BTA account, you will still have to reconcile the existing agent fee plus the WTI credit in another expense report to offset each other.

Please add the Agent Fee to a new report by itself and submit it into workflow for processing.

Thank you.
